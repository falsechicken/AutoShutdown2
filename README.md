- AutoShutdown2 Plugin for Rocket -

Licensed under the GPLv2.

This plugin is a rewrite of my old AutoShutdown plugin. It allows the server to be shutdown at specified times and provide custom warnings as well.

The default configuration will shutdown the server every few hours with a warning 5 minutes before. Use this as an example when reconfiguring. The config file should be self explanatory.
